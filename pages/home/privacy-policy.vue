We only access your device camera roll and camera with your permission. If you need to update your permissions, you can do so in your device&rsquo;s settings. Please remember that Tipper may, but has no obligation to, monitor, record, and store Usage Information in order to protect your safety or the safety of other users, to assist with regulatory or law enforcement efforts, to protect and defend our rights and property, or for other reasons relating to our provision of the Services. By using the Services, you consent to the recording, storage, and disclosure of such information you send or receive for these purposes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Contact List Information&nbsp;</strong>With your permission, we may access your contact list on your mobile device or in your email accounts so that you can identify your contacts on the Services and direct the invitation of your contacts.

We make these recommendations based on your contact list information as well as, with their consent, your contacts&rsquo; information if they are also a Tipper customer. We only access your contact list information with your explicit permission. If you provide us with personal data from your third-party contacts, it is your responsibility to ensure that the communication of such data to, and further processing by, Tipper is lawful. For example, when you provide us with information about your contacts, we may use it to let you know which of your contacts have also signed up for our Services or, at your exclusive direction, send messages to your contacts regarding our Services. We will not send messages to your contacts that are not explicitly directed by you.</p>
                        <p><br></p>
                        <p><strong>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p>
                        <p>As is true of many digital platforms, we collect certain personal information automatically when you use the Tipper Services, including:</p>
                        <p><br></p>
                        <p><strong>Location Data.&nbsp;</strong>To help us protect against fraud, provide the Tipper Services to you, and improve our services, we collect location data, including current and historical information concerning a user&rsquo;s geographic location, GPS location, transaction location, and IP addresses that they use in conjunction with our Services. We collect your precise location data with your permission, and use that information, for example, to help protect against fraud by detecting and declining debit card transactions that may occur far away from your device&rsquo;s location. We collect information about your location through GPS, Wi-Fi, wireless network triangulation, or other methods in order to obtain your location. We may also approximate your location by your IP Address. We also use the Google Maps API to gather information about your location. Google uses various technologies to determine your location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers (see Google&rsquo;s Privacy Policy to learn more).</p>
                        <p><br></p>
                        <p><strong>Usage and Device Data Collected Automatically Through Tracking Technologies.&nbsp;</strong>To provide a personalized and enhanced user experience, we, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or use our Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, location identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, &ldquo;Tracking Technologies&rdquo;). For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID (that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or your account), and other similar information. We use Tracking Technologies to help ensure that you have a high-quality experience on our Services. We also use Tracking Technologies to aid in the targeted advertising of our services on other platforms. From your device manufacturer, we also may collect the names of other third-party applications that you have downloaded on your device.</p>
                        <p>If you prefer, you can change your cookie settings. Some browsers have options that allow the user to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the user each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your settings, but doing so will limit the range of features available to you on our Services and other websites. Be sure to read any information provided by your browser developer to understand the limitations of these settings, as they may differ from browser to browser and may not apply to all technologies. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email, used our Services, or performed certain functions with it.</p>
                        <p>Our Services also occasionally use &ldquo;local shared objects&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;Flash cookies&rdquo;). Like browser cookies, Flash cookies may be used for coordinating content delivery, website functionality, maintaining preferences, advertising, or analytics. Unlike browser cookies, &ldquo;Flash cookies&rdquo; are not stored in the browser. You may be able to manage these Flash cookies by visiting the Adobe website&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html">here</a> .</p>
                        <p><em>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</em> . Some web browsers transmit &ldquo;do-not-track&rdquo; signals to websites. We currently don&rsquo;t take action in response to these signals.</p>
                        <p><br></p>
                        <p><strong>Personal Information from Other Sources and Third Parties:</strong></p>
