It allows employees to receive tips and track their earnings. It also allows employers to track the tip activity each employee receives as well as the reviews they are given. Employers sign up for Tipper and get access to a dashboard that provides this information. Tipper allows for guests/customers to use QR codes and digital links to access Tipper and send a tip. We may come out with new features in the future and will communicate these new features through our website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

For example, if you send a tip funded by a bank account and the bank informs us it cannot cover the payment due to a lack of funds or a dispute, we may hold you liable for the payment, or if you were the recipient of that payment, we may reverse that payment from your account to cover the liability.</p>

If you believe that a payment initiated with your Tipper account was not authorized, then you must notify us immediately, even if you (or someone else) disputes the transaction with the card issuer or originating bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

                        </ol>
                        <p class="p2"><strong>What are holds and limitations</strong></p>
                        <p class="p2">Under certain circumstances, in order to protect Tipper and the security and integrity of the network that uses the Tipper Services, Tipper may, in its sole discretion, take account-level or transaction-level actions. A hold may be placed on your account.</p>
                        <p class="p2">Our decision about holds and limitations may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of Tipper, our customers and/or service providers. We may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your Tipper account. In addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions. We have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.</p>
                        <p class="p2"><strong>Holds</strong></p>
                        <p class="p2">A hold is an action that Tipper may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level. When Tipper places a temporary hold on a tip, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient. Tipper reviews many factors before placing a hold on a tip, including: account tenure, transaction activity, and past disputes.</p>
                        <p class="p2"><strong>Holds based on Tipper&rsquo;s risk decisions</strong></p>
                        <p class="p2">We may place a hold on transactions involving your Tipper account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements. We make decisions about whether to place a hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.</p>
                        <p class="p2">Risk-based holds may remain in place for up to 180 days from the date the transaction was made. We may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances, but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.</p>
                        <p class="p2"><strong>Account Limitations</strong></p>
                        <p class="p2">Limitations may be placed on your account to help protect Tipper and Tipper users when we notice restricted activities or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious. Limitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your Tipper account open.</p>
                        <p class="p2">There are several reasons why your Tipper account could be limited, including:</p>
                        <ul class="ul1">
                            <li class="li3">If we suspect someone could be using your Tipper account without your knowledge, we&rsquo;ll limit it for your protection and look into the unusual activity.</li>
                            <li class="li3">If another financial institution alerts us that someone has used one of your linked payment methods without permission.</li>
                            <li class="li3">In order to comply with the law.</li>
                            <li class="li2">If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full"><span class="s8">Acceptable Use Policy</span></a>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="p2">You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed. Normally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request. However, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect us, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.</p>
                        <ol class="ol1">

                        <p class="p2">If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your Tipper account, placing a hold or limitation on your Tipper account, or releasing your funds. We will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us. We do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your Tipper account. When we implement a hold or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.</p>

                        <p class="p2">To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your Tipper account, you should regularly log into your Tipper account and review your account statement. We will notify you by sending an email to your primary email address on file. You should review these notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.</p>

If you do not tell us within 3 days after the transaction, you may not get back any money if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.

                        <p class="p2"><strong>Tipper&rsquo;s liability is limited with respect to your Tipper account and your use of the Tipper Services.</strong> In no event shall Tipper be liable for lost profits or any special, incidental or consequential damages (including without limitation damages for loss of data or loss of business) arising out of or in connection with our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Tipper Services) operated by us or on our behalf, any of the Tipper Services, or this user agreement (however arising, including negligence), unless and to the extent prohibited by law.</p>
                        <p class="p2">Our liability to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to the actual amount of direct damages.

We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, and credit cards are processed in a timely manner but we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the Tipper Services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or U.S. or international financial services. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.</p>
                        <p class="p2"><strong>Your Release of Us</strong></p>
                        <p class="p2">If you have a dispute with any other Tipper account holder, you release us from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
